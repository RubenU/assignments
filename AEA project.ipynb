    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> In financial literature, it is evident that markets react tremendously fast on information in the market. Rapid advances in computing, technologies, and the internet, have profoundly changed the dynamics of financial markets ([Fan, Stallaert and Whinston, 2000](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=353368)). Information has become widely available and individuals are able to process information faster. More and more people are trading online instead of using full-service brokerages. Due to the large number of players in the markets, as new information arrives, stock prices tend to be either over- or undervalued. Everyone desires to profit from the new information. People overreact, in violations to Bayes’ rule, to unexpected news [(Bondt and Thaler, 1985)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1985.tb05004.x/full), which causes fast changes in prices. Another phenomenon that causes over- or undervalued security prices is the irrationality of individuals. Although humans can act rationally and find patterns in stock prices, the emotional side is a disadvantage when it comes to trading. Often too eager or afraid for losses ([Tversky and Kahneman, 1991](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2937956.pdf)), we can choose options that are suboptimal. While not under pressure, we can make more optimal decisions, therefore it makes sense to code our beliefs and strategy, so that a part of human irrationality can be avoided. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> This notebook tries to find out whether these inefficiencies can be exploited. It uses indicators that solely observe data and processes it without human emotion involved. Like professional stock traders, we use real time data for our research. We use the AEX-index for analysis, because price movements are more smoothened relative to individual securities. This is due to the fact that the AEX-index consists of the weighted market capitalization of the 25 largest listed firms in the Netherlands.  </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> The outline of this notebook is as follows: we first start with some assumptions for this research, after which we continue with the data import. We then continue with the methodology and model building. The results are presented, followed by conclusions. Lastly, we discuss what the shortcomings of this research are and recommendations are discussed.  </p>"

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> It is extremely difficult to find real time data that is available on the internet without losing the confidence that the data is legit. For this very reason, we created our own dataset. On the website [one.iex.nl](https://one.iex.nl) real time data can be found. The issue with this data is that it cannot be downloaded or imported. By using the PIL library and an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine called [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) , we were able to import the prices into a Pandas Dataframe. The OCR engine we have used is not a standard package in Python, but by installing and linking the right directory towards [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) OCR we were able to import the dataset. We first import the necessary libraries and set up a DataFrame, as can be seen in the code block below. </p>"

There are points where the difference between the confidence intervals and the AEX-index is fairly big. This is our indication for a price movement that is happening or bound to happen. As can be distilled from the graph, when the difference between the +95% interval and the AEX-index is large, a downward price movement is happening/continuing. The opposite holds for an upward price movement. The code below constructs those signals and converts them to a binary number.

The code below runs over the complete dataset and 'buys' and 'sells' when the criteria above are matched. There are two types of positions, a long position and a short position. A long position is buying the security with the expectation that the price is going to increase.  A short position means that we expect a drop in the price of the security, so we will sell the secutity in *t = 0*, and buy it at a lower price in *t = 1*. From the previous graph we observe that we should close our position when there is an intersection with a confidence interval. In the code below, we only have one open position at the time, which can be a long or short position. Lastly, we construct a column in our dataframe which captures the potential profit. <p\\>"

The standard optimization library of python cannot optimize our parameter values since we have created new column values after each iteration. So, in order to find a local optimum, we are going to itterate over a series of values for we think that it entails an optimum. An important assumption here is that the order in which we find an optimal value for a parameter is irrelevant (while in reality this is likely not true). The bandwith of the series is not too wide since the code takes a lot of computational time. The used series value for the parameter and the outcome (profit) is then put into a dictionary. <p\\>"
