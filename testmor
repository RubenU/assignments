<p style="text-align: justify;"> In financial literature, it is evident that markets react tremendously fast on information in the market. Rapid advances in computing, technologies, and the internet, have profoundly changed the dynamics of financial markets [Fan, Stallaert and Whinston, 2000](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=353368). Information has become widely available and individuals are able to process information faster. More and more people are trading online instead of using full-service brokerages. Due to the large number of players in the markets, as new information arrives, stock prices tend to be either over- or undervalued. Everyone desires to profit from the new information. People overreact, in violations to Bayesâ€™ rule, to unexpected news [Bondt and Thaler, 1985](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1985.tb05004.x/full), which causes fast changes in prices. Another phenomenon that causes over- or undervalued security prices is the irrationality of individuals. Although humans can act rationally and find patterns in stock prices, the emotional side is a disadvantage when it comes to trading. Often too eager or afraid for losses [Tversky and Kahneman, 1991](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2937956.pdf)., we can choose options that are suboptimal. While not under pressure, we can make more optimal decisions, therefore it makes sense to code our beliefs and strategy, so that a part of human irrationality can be avoided. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> This notebook tries to find out whether these inefficiencies can be exploited. It uses indicators that solely observe data and processes it without human emotion involved. Like professional stock traders, we use real time data for our research. We use the AEX-index for analysis, because price movements are more smoothened relative to individual securities. This is due to the fact that the AEX-index consists of the weighted market capitalization of the 25 largest listed firms in the Netherlands.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The outline of this notebook is as follows: we first start with some assumptions for this research, after which we continue with the data import. We then continue with the methodology and model building. The results are presented, followed by conclusions. Lastly, we discuss what the shortcomings of this research are and recommendations are discussed.  </p>
